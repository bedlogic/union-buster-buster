<p><strong>Union Buster Buster</strong> was made in two days for GAMERella 2014: "Boss Up" at <a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Game Center</a>. We wrote the game in <a href="http://unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unity</a>. We created the sprites in <a href="https://github.com/Pixen/Pixen" target="_blank">Pixen</a>. We wrote the music on Gameboy using <a href="http://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/" target="_blank">LSDJ</a>. We wrote the website in <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> and html. Inspired by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/abetterkaplan" target="_blank">Teachers and Students for a Better Kaplan</a> and <a href="http://rudemechanicalorchestra.org/" target="_blank">Rude Mechanical Orchestra</a>.</p>
